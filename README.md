# Library for Competitive Programming

This repository contains the implementation of some of the Data Structures and Algorithms used in Competitive Programming.

The main languages of implementation are **Java** and **Rust**.

Currently, the DS/Algorithms covered:
- [Template (With fast I/O)](https://github.com/SarthakMathur2182/CompetitiveProgramming/tree/main/Template)
- [Sparse Table](https://github.com/SarthakMathur2182/CompetitiveProgramming/tree/main/SparseTable)
- [Segment Tree](https://github.com/SarthakMathur2182/CompetitiveProgramming/tree/main/SegmentTree)
- [Modular Arithmetic](https://github.com/SarthakMathur2182/CompetitiveProgramming/tree/main/ModInt)
- Graph (In experiment, might remove later)

More implementations might be covered in the future.
