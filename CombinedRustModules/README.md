# Combined Rust Modules

There are some modules, which are used at a lot of places. For example,
the [math](https://github.com/SarthakMathur2182/CompetitiveProgramming/blob/main/CombinedRustModules/math.rs) module is
used in both [Binary Search](https://github.com/SarthakMathur2182/CompetitiveProgramming/blob/main/BinarySearch/bs.rs)
and [Modular Arithmetic](https://github.com/SarthakMathur2182/CompetitiveProgramming/blob/main/ModInt/mod_int.rs).

Instead of have them everywhere, I decided to have them at a single place. Easier to maintain.
