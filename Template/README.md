# Main Template (With I/O)

I've tried to write the Rust template on my own, so don't expect much performance from this.
Maybe I'll work more on this in the future.

When running the code, I pass `-DEBUG` as an argument, which runs the code having multiple inputs pasted after one another.

In Java, `-DEBUG` also decides whether to print the debug statements or not. In Rust, I use `dbg!()`.
